# BERT-LLM Classification Fine-Tuning and Serving Pipeline

This repository contains a pipeline for fine-tuning a BERT-LLM model on a classification task and serving the model using the Union AI workflow and inference platform. 

## Project Setup
The quickest way to setup and the run the tutorial notebook is often using a hosted notebook, like Google colab.

</a>

Or you can follow the steps below to setup the project locally.

### Sign up for a Union account
Serverless is the easiest way to get started with Union. You can sign up for a free account and $30 of credit at [Union Serverless](https://app.union.ai/signup). BYOC (Bring Your Own Cloud) is also available for more features and advanced users. [Schedule a demo](https://www.union.ai/contact) to learn more about Union BYOC.

- Union Serverless Sign-up: https://www.union.ai/
- Union BYOC: https://docs.union.ai/byoc/user-guide/union-overview#union-byoc

### Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/unionai-oss/bert-llm-classification-pipeline
cd bert-llm-classification-pipeline
```

### Install dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Authenticate to Union from CLI
After you have signed up for Union, you can authenticate to Union from the CLI.

If on Union Serverless
`union create login --serverless --auth device-flow`

If on Union BYOC (Bring Your Own Cloud)
`union create login --host <union-host-url>`

Now your environment is setup to run the project on remotely Union.

### Run through the tutorial notebook or run the pipeline from CLI.
The tutorial notebook will guide you through the steps to fine-tune a BERT-LLM model on a classification task and serve the model using Union AI.

```bash
jupyter notebook tutorial.ipynb
```

Or you can run the steps for the training pipeline and serving from the CLI.

Train the model:
```bash
```

Serve the model:
```bash
```

Run Batch Inference:
```bash
```

Run Near Real-time Batch Inference with Actors:
```bash
```
